# Router + Controller

The starting point for any new link in our app is to first define a `route` to support this link. All supported routes are defined in `routes.js`

This is the current version:

## routes.js

~~~js
'use strict';

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

const dashboard = require('./controllers/dashboard.js');
const about = require('./controllers/about.js');

router.get('/', dashboard.index);
router.get('/dashboard', dashboard.index);
router.get('/about', about.index);

module.exports = router;
~~~

In particular, these are the three routes currently supported:

~~~js
router.get('/', dashboard.index);
router.get('/dashboard', dashboard.index);
router.get('/about', about.index);
~~~

These are the three patterns our app responds to: `/`, `/dashboard` and `/about`. Any other pattern will generate a not found error from our app.

We now have a new pattern `/playlist/id`, which we would like to route to a controller that would render a new view detailing the playlist contents. Also note that each of these statements matches a route pattern with a function inside a controller. 

So, for instance, this import + route:

~~~js
const about = require('./controllers/about.js');
...
router.get('/about', about.index);
~~~

... ensures that this function would be called if the route was triggered:

~~~js
const about = {
  index(request, response) {
    const viewData = {
      title: 'About Playlist Maker',
    };
    response.render('about', viewData);
  },
};
~~~

Make sure you understand this connection before proceeding. Try changing the spelling of the index method for instance - and see what happens (make sure to change it back!).
