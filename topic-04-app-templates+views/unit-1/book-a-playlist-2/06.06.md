# Deleting Songs : Part 2

There are many techniques for deleting an element from an array, which require more in depth Javascript knowledge. However, we have a simpler solution for the moment via the `lodash` library.

At the top of our `playlist-store.js` module, import this library:

## models/playlist-store.js

~~~js
const _ = require('lodash');
~~~

Here is the complete `removeSong` function:

~~~js
  removeSong(id, songId) {
    const playlist = this.getPlaylist(id);
    _.remove(playlist.songs, { id: songId });
  },
~~~

This library is already installed in our project template - and you can read about how it works and what is does:

This is a modern, comprehensive library for managing data structures in Javascript. This video is the introduction to a series on lodash:

Which will give you a very brief idea of some of the features of this library. This library has many features and capabilities and we will explore some of them in subsequent labs.

As a start - we can simplify the `getPlaylist` function:

~~~js
  getPlaylist(id) {
    let foundPlaylist = null;
    for (let playlist of this.playlistCollection) {
      if (id == playlist.id) {
        foundPlaylist = playlist;
      }
    }

    return foundPlaylist;
  },
~~~

This performs a linear search to locate and return a playlist with a matching id. This can be simplified using lodash:

~~~js
  getPlaylist(id) {
    return _.find(this.playlistCollection, { id: id });
  },
~~~

In future, when we are working with our playlists, we will usually check with lodash when we need to do anything, to see if it has a shorter/easier technique than writing our own algorithms.
