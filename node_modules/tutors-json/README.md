# tutors-json

A HTML generator for the tutors reader:

- <https://github.com/edeleastar/tutors-design>

This project will build a json version of the site for consumption by the above project. To see it in action

```
git clone https://github.com/tutors-sdk/tutors-starter.git
npx tutors-json
```

This will generate a json version of the site in ./json.

To deploy the site for the reader, see [this lab step here](https://tutors-design.netlify.app/lab/tutors-course.netlify.app/topic-00-tutors-next/book-next/03).

The design of the system is discussed here:
