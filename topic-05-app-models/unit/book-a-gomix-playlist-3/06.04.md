# Persistence

You will note that, even though we are able to add/delete playlists/songs, every time the app restarts then we are left with the same initial playlist. i.e. none of the changes we make are `persisted` beyond the life of the program execution.

This is the field of databases - and beyond the scope of this course for the moment. However, we can implement something like a database, but simpler, which can serve our needs. Introduce this new class into the project:

## models/json-store.js

~~~js
'use strict';

const low = require('lowdb');
const FileSync = require('lowdb/adapters/FileSync')

class JsonStore {
  constructor(file, defaults) {
    const adapter = new FileSync(file)
    this.db = low(adapter)
    this.db.defaults(defaults).value();
  }

  save() {
    this.db.write();
  }

  add(collection, obj) {
    this.db.get(collection).push(obj).last().value();
  }

  remove(collection, obj) {
    this.db.get(collection).remove(obj).value();
  }

  removeAll(collection) {
    this.db.get(collection).remove().value();
  }

  findAll(collection) {
    return this.db.get(collection).value();
  }

  findOneBy(collection, filter) {
    const results = this.db.get(collection).filter(filter).value();
    return results[0];
  }

  findByIds(collection, ids) {
    return this.db.get(collection).keyBy('id').at(ids).value();
  }

  findBy(collection, filter) {
    return this.db.get(collection).filter(filter).value();
  }
}

module.exports = JsonStore;
~~~

This is a wrapper around this module:

- <https://github.com/typicode/lowdb>

It will manage the json file we have been using, enabling updates in a convenient manner. You do not need to understand this module in depth for the moment, we will use another wrapper module to interact with it.

Here is the wraper, which is a new version of our playlist store module:

## models/playlist-store.js

~~~js
'use strict';

const _ = require('lodash');
const JsonStore = require('./json-store');

const playlistStore = {

  store: new JsonStore('./models/playlist-store.json', { playlistCollection: [] }),
  collection: 'playlistCollection',

  getAllPlaylists() {
    return this.store.findAll(this.collection);
  },

  getPlaylist(id) {
    return this.store.findOneBy(this.collection, { id: id });
  },

  addPlaylist(playlist) {
    this.store.add(this.collection, playlist);
    this.store.save();
  },

  removePlaylist(id) {
    const playlist = this.getPlaylist(id);
    this.store.remove(this.collection, playlist);
    this.store.save();
  },

  removeAllPlaylists() {
    this.store.removeAll(this.collection);
    this.store.save();
  },

  addSong(id, song) {
    const playlist = this.getPlaylist(id);
    playlist.songs.push(song);
    this.store.save();
  },

  removeSong(id, songId) {
    const playlist = this.getPlaylist(id);
    const songs = playlist.songs;
    _.remove(songs, { id: songId});
    this.store.save();
  },
};

module.exports = playlistStore;
~~~

No other changes are necessary - as all access to the playlist is via the above module.

The app should work now as before, except this time changes to the playlists will be `persisted` to the json file. This means that if the app has to be restarted, it will have preserved any changes to the playlist in the JSON file, which will be reloaded when the app restarts.

You can force a reload by deliberately introducing a syntax error - and then correcting it.

However, because of limitations in the way glitch is currently configured the playlist-store.json file will often not be in sync and not be updated at all. If you download and run the application locally (in webstorm), the json file will be updated accurately.
