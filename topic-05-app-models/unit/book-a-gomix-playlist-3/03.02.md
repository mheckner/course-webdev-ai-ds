# ID Management

Deleting a song you have manually added using the form generates the following:

~~~
Cannot GET /playlist/02/deletesong/
~~~

However, pre-populated songs can still be deleted. What is going on here?

The issue is that the new songs we have added do not appear to have IDs. Looking at this list for instance:

![](img/02.png)

In the browser, right-click and select 'view source' and you should see something like this:

Look at the last entry - there is no ID for the new song we added.

Here is our `addsong` function again:

## controlers/playlist.js

~~~js
  addSong(request, response) {
    const playlistId = request.params.id;
    const playlist = playlistStore.getPlaylist(playlistId);
    const newSong = {
      title: request.body.title,
      artist: request.body.artist,
    };
    playlistStore.addSong(playlistId, newSong);
    response.redirect('/playlist/' + playlistId);
  },
~~~

The object we are inserting has only two fields:

~~~js
    const newSong = {
      title: request.body.title,
      artist: request.body.artist,
    };
~~~

We need to also insert a new, unique, ID for each object we create.

How do we create a new ID? This can be challenged in implement manually. However, one solution is to use Universally Unique Identifiers:

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier>

A library to generate a uuid is already in our app, we just need to import and use it

At the top of the `playlist` controller, we require the library. Insert this at the top of the modile:

## controllers/playlists.js
~~~
const uuid = require('uuid');
~~~

Now, when we are creating a playlist, we can use the library to generate a unique id for us:

~~~js
  const newSong = {
    id: uuid.v1(),
    title: request.body.title,
    artist: request.body.artist,
  };
~~~

This is the complete playlist module at this stage:

~~~
"use strict";

const logger = require("../utils/logger");
const playlistStore = require("../models/playlist-store");
const uuid = require('uuid');

const playlist = {
  index(request, response) {
    const playlistId = request.params.id;
    logger.debug("Playlist id = ", playlistId);
    const viewData = {
      title: "Playlist",
      playlist: playlistStore.getPlaylist(playlistId)
    };
    response.render("playlist", viewData);
  },

  deleteSong(request, response) {
    const playlistId = request.params.id;
    const songId = request.params.songid;
    logger.debug(`Deleting Song ${songId} from Playlist ${playlistId}`);
    playlistStore.removeSong(playlistId, songId);
    response.redirect("/playlist/" + playlistId);
  },
  
  addSong(request, response) {
    const playlistId = request.params.id;
    const playlist = playlistStore.getPlaylist(playlistId);
    const newSong = {
      id: uuid.v1(),
      title: request.body.title,
      artist: request.body.artist,
    };
    playlistStore.addSong(playlistId, newSong);
    response.redirect('/playlist/' + playlistId);
  },
};

module.exports = playlist;
~~~

Try this now and make sure the new songs can be deleted. View the source to reveal the uuid-style ids in the new songs:

In addition, we can add a log statement so that we can see the songs as they are added:

~~~
...
    logger.debug('New Song = ', newSong);
...
~~~
