# Adding playlists

Taking the last step as an example, we can quickly implement the necessary form, route, controller function and model update to support adding a new playlist (as opposed to a song).

This is a new addplaylist partial:

## views/partials/addplaylist.hbs

~~~html
<form class="ui stacked segment form" action="/dashboard/addplaylist" method="POST">
  <div class="field">
    <label>Title</label>
    <input placeholder="Title" type="text" name="title">
  </div>
  <button class="ui blue submit button">Add Playlist</button>
</form>
~~~

Modify dashboard to append this partial:

## views/dashboard.hbs

~~~html
{{> menu id="dashboard"}}

<section class="ui segment">
  {{> listplaylists}}
  {{> addplaylist}}
</section>
~~~

This now requires a new route:

## routes.js

~~~js
router.post('/dashboard/addplaylist', dashboard.addPlaylist);
~~~

.. and this is the new method on the dashboard controller:

## controllers/dashboard.js

Import the uuid library at the top:

~~~js
const uuid = require('uuid');
~~~

... and then this new method"

~~~
...
  addPlaylist(request, response) {
    const newPlayList = {
      id: uuid.v1(),
      title: request.body.title,
      songs: [],
    };
    playlistStore.addPlaylist(newPlayList);
    response.redirect('/dashboard');
  },
~~~

Notice we are again using the uuid library here to generate and ID for the new playlist.

Finally, a new method in the playlist-store to add a playlist:

## modes/playlist-store.js

~~~js
addPlaylist(playlist) {
  this.playlistCollection.push(playlist);
},
~~~

We should now be able to add new playlists.
