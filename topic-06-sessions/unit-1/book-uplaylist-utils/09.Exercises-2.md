# Exercise 2

Encapsulate Playlist Shortest Song + Duration in a single object for the view to render.

#### Solution

Revise the playlist controlled index method as follows:

#### controllers/playlist.js

~~~javascript
//...
const playlist = {
  index(request, response) {
    const playlistId = request.params.id;
    logger.debug("Playlist id = ", playlistId);
    const playlist = playlistStore.getPlaylist(playlistId);
    const viewData = {
      title: "Playlist",
      playlist: playlist,
      playlistSummary : {
        shortestSong : playlistAnalytics.getShortestSong(playlist),
        duration : playlistAnalytics.getPlaylistDuration(playlist)
      }
    };
    response.render("playlist", viewData);
  },
  //...
~~~

Notice the revised structure of the viewData object:

~~~javascript
    const viewData = {
      title: "Playlist",
      playlist: playlist,
      playlistSummary : {
        shortestSong : playlistAnalytics.getShortestSong(playlist),
        duration : playlistAnalytics.getPlaylistDuration(playlist)
      }
    };
~~~

... we are defining a new object `playlistSummary` inside viewData - which will encapsulate the two computed properties. In the view, we access these directly:

~~~handlebars
  <h4> Total Duration: {{playlistSummary.duration}}; Shortest song: {{playlistSummary.shortestSong.title}}</h4>
~~~

This encapsulate helps keep our code more concise and meaningful.
