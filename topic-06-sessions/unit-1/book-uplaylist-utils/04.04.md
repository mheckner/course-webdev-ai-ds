# Test the Algorithm

The appropriate place to call the algorithm could be just before we display the playlist in the `playlist` controller index method. It looks like this currently:

### playlist.js

~~~java
  index(request, response) {
    const playlistId = request.params.id;
    logger.debug("Playlist id = ", playlistId);
    const viewData = {
      title: "Playlist",
      playlist: playlistStore.getPlaylist(playlistId)
    };
    response.render("playlist", viewData);
  },
~~~

Here is a revision:

~~~java
  index(request, response) {
    const playlistId = request.params.id;
    logger.debug("Playlist id = ", playlistId);

    let shortestSong = null;
    const playlist = playlistStore.getPlaylist(playlistId)
    if (playlist.songs.length > 0) {
      shortestSong = playlist.songs[0];
      for (let i = 1; i < playlist.songs.length; i++) {
        if (playlist.songs[i].duration < shortestSong.duration) {
          shortestSong = playlist.songs[i];
        }
      }
    }
    console.log(shortestSong);
    const viewData = {
      title: "Playlist",
      playlist: playlistStore.getPlaylist(playlistId)
    };
    response.render("playlist", viewData);
  },
~~~

Run this now. It doesn't display anything on the view - however we are logging the shortest song:

~~~bash
{
  id: '06',
  title: 'Piano Sonata No. 10',
  artist: 'Beethoven',
  genre: 'Classical',
  duration: 4
}
~~~

Visit each of the different playlists and verify that the correct shortest songs is being listed.
