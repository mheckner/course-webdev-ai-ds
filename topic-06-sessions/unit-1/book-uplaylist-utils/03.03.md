# Develop the Algorithm

Lets first consider an algorithm to find the shortest song. You might be tempted by a google search:

- <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19432769/find-smallest-value-in-array-without-math-min/42524263>

~~~javascript
ar arr = [5,1,9,5,7];
var smallest = arr[0];

for(var i=1; i<arr.length; i++){
    if(arr[i] < smallest){
        smallest = arr[i];   
    }
}

console.log(smallest);
~~~

This looks reasonable - however it is an simple int array, not the playlist data structure we have ben using. However, the approach seems sound - have a look at this version:

~~~javascript
    let shortestSong = null;
    const playlist = playlistStore.getPlaylist(playlistId)
    if (playlist.songs.length > 0) {
      shortestSong = playlist.songs[0];
      for (let i = 1; i < playlist.songs.length; i++) {
        shortestSong = playlist.songs[i];
      }
    }
~~~

We have implemented more or less the same approach :

- Initialise an (empty) object to contain the shortestSong
- Get a playlist from the store
- Set shortestSong to the first song in the array (if there is one)
- Loop through the array until we reach the end
- If we locate any shorter song, set it to shortestSong
