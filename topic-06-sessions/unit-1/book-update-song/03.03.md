# Model Changes

To support update, we extend the playlist-store.js component with 2 additional methods:

## models/playlist-store.js

~~~js
  getSong(id, songId) {
    const playList = this.store.findOneBy(this.collection, { id: id });
    const songs = playList.songs.filter(song => song.id == songId);
    return songs[0];
  },

  updateSong(song, updatedSong) {
    song.title = updatedSong.title;
    song.artist = updatedSong.artist;
    song.duration = updatedSong.duration;
    this.store.save();
  }
~~~

`getSong` retrieves a song object given its playlist + song id.

`updateSong` accepts an existing song + modified (edited) version of the song, overwrites each field (whether it is changed or not), and then saves the updated song.

Note that to save the song - we just save the entire playlist database. For a large model this would clearly be not very efficient. However, our database is very simple, and intended for very small applications (like ours).
