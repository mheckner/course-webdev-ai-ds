# Playlist Model

If your project has any playlists in the json store, delete them now. Your store should look like this:

## models/playlist-store.json

~~~
{
  "playlistCollection": [
  ]
}
~~~

You can do this via the UX, or you can just delete them from playlist-store.json directly.

This has completely emptied our application of data. We are doing this as we are about to make some changes to how the store is represented.

We need a new method in the playlist-store module, which will retrieve a playlist based on a specific user id.

## models/playlist-store.js

~~~
...
  getUserPlaylists(userid) {
    return this.store.findBy(this.collection, { userid: userid });
  },
...
~~~

This new method takes a userid, and will only fetch playlists belonging to the user with the specific id. We have'nt introduced the User model yet - nor are we storing playlists with such an id. We will make these changes in the next steps...
