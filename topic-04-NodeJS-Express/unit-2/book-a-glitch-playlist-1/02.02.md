# Playlist

We are going to evolve this project into a simple playlist appication, enabling a user to create a playlist of songs. In this step, we will layout a static version.

First, we can make some simple changes to re brand the app as `Playlist 1` instead of `Template 1`

First replace the existing corresponding lines of code with each of the following in the views:

## views/partials/menu.hbs

~~~html
...
  <header class="ui header item"> Playlist 1 </header>
...
~~~

## views/about.hbs

~~~html
...
  <h3>
    Playlist 1
  </h3>
  <p>
    A Little Playlist Maker - Version 1
  </p>
...
~~~

Now the controllers - adjust the viewData objects as shown:

## controllers/about.js

~~~javascript
...
    const viewData = {
      title: 'About Playlist 1'
    };
...
~~~

## controllers/dashboard.js

~~~javascript
...
    const viewData = {
      title: 'Playlist 1 Dashboard'
    };
...
~~~

Make sure the app is still running, but with the new branding. If there are errors, turn the logs and you may be able to see the source of the problem - which will usually be some small error in the javascript sources.
