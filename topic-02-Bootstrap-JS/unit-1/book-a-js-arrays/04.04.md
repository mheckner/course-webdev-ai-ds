# Array Iteration: While loops

Along with `for` loops, we can also use a `while` loop. Unlike `for` loops, `while` loops only take a `condition`. This means that you need to handle initialization before the loop, and incrementing/decrementing yourself inside of the loop. If you forget to increment/decrement inside the loop, the loop will never terminate! Instead, you'll be stuck in what's called an _infinite loop_!

Here's an example of a working `while` loop:

~~~javascript
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
~~~

Here's how we could rewrite our rounding example to use a `while` loop:

~~~javascript
let decimals3 = [1.1, 1.6, 2.8, 0.4, 3.5, 1.6];
let j = 0;

while (j < decimals.length) {
  decimals3[j] = Math.round(decimals[j]);
  j++;
}
~~~

### Iteration: Do While Loops

Similar to while loops, we can also write `do...while` loops, which specify our `condition` at the end. Here is an example:

~~~javascript
let k = 0;
do {
  console.log(k);
  k++;
} while (k < 5);
~~~

The main difference between a `while` loop and a `do...while` loop is that the code inside of a `do...while` loop is guaranteed to execute at least once. For example:

~~~javascript
let m = 0;
while (m < 0) {
  console.log(m);
  m++;
}

// nothing is logged, since 0 < 0 is false

let n = 0;
do {
  console.log(n);
  n++;
} while (n < 0);

// 0 gets logged, since the code inside the block runs once
// before the while condition is checked
~~~

Here's how we could rewrite our rounding example to use a `do...while` loop:

~~~javascript
const decimals4 = [1.1, 1.6, 2.8, 0.4, 3.5, 1.6];
var p = 0;

do {
  decimals4[p] = Math.round(decimals4[p]);
  p++;
} while (p < decimals4.length);
~~~

### Exiting out of loops

Sometimes we want to exit a loop before it has finished. To do that, we use the word `break`

~~~javascript
for (let q = 0; q < 5; q++) {
  if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
    console.log('Breaking out of the loop when q is ' + q);
    break;
  }
  else {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
~~~

We can also skip the current iteration and continue the loop at the next step in the itration by using the word `continue`

~~~javascript
for (let r = 0; r < 5; r++) {
  if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
    console.log('Skipping the console.log when i is ' + r);
    continue;
  }
  console.log(i);
}
~~~

- arrays-04.js

And use the developer tools in chrome to run and monitor the script.

# Exercise 1: Iteration

Using this array:

~~~javascript
const people = ['Greg', 'Mary', 'Devon', 'James'];
~~~

- Using a loop, iterate through `people` array and after logging "Mary", exit from the loop.
- Write code to make a copy of the array
- Write the code that gives the index of where "Mary" is located.
- Write the code that gives the index of where "Foo" is located (this should return `-1`).
