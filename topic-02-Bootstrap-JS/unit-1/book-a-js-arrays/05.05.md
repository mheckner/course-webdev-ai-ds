# Arrays of Objects

Create a file called `arrays3.js` declare this array:

~~~javascript
const songList = [
  'Piano Sonata No. 3',
  'Piano Sonata No. 7',
  'Piano Sonata No. 10',
];

console.log(songList);
~~~

We can write a loop to print out the elements individually:

~~~javascript
for (let i = 0; i < songList.length; i++) {
  console.log('Song ' + i + ':' + songList[i]);
}
~~~

This should render as:

~~~javascript
Song 0:Piano Sonata No. 3
Song 1:Piano Sonata No. 7
Song 2:Piano Sonata No. 10
~~~

What if we wanted to record both the song and the artist? We could try this:

~~~javascript
const songList2 = [
  'Piano Sonata No. 3',
  'Beethoven',
  'Piano Sonata No. 7',
  'Beethoven',
  'Piano Sonata No. 10',
  'Beethoven',
];

for (let k = 0; k < songList2.length; k++) {
  console.log('Song ' + k + ':' + songList2[k]);
}
~~~

This code outputs the array to the console like this:

~~~bash
Song 0:Piano Sonata No. 3
Song 1:Beethoven
Song 2:Piano Sonata No. 7
Song 3:Beethoven
Song 4:Piano Sonata No. 10
Song 5:Beethoven
~~~

However, this is very inconvenient and difficult to manage. The output above does not really represent our intention. We could try this:

~~~javascript
for (let k = 0; k < songList2.length; k=k+2) {
  console.log('Song ' + k + ': Title: ' + songList2[k] + ': Artist: ' + songList2[k + 1]);
}
~~~

Which outputs:

~~~bash
Song 0: Title: Piano Sonata No. 3: Artist: Beethoven
Song 2: Title: Piano Sonata No. 7: Artist: Beethoven
Song 4: Title: Piano Sonata No. 10: Artist: Beethoven
~~~

Closer to our intention - but still not satisfactory (the Song numbers look wrong).

Instead of an array of strings, we need an array of `songs`, with each song containing a title + artist:
~~~javascript
const songList3 = [
  {
    title: 'Piano Sonata No. 3',
    artist: 'Beethoven',
  },
  {
    title: 'Piano Sonata No. 7',
    artist: 'Beethoven',
  },
  {
    title: 'Piano Sonata No. 10',
    artist: 'Beethoven',
  },
];
~~~

Look carefully at the above - we are defining an array as before, but each array is an object containing two fields:

- title
- artist

We can now output the play list more conveniently:

~~~javascript
for (let j = 0; j < songList3.length; j++) {
  console.log('Song ' + j + ': Title: ' + songList3[j].title + ': Artist: ' + songList3[j].artist);
}
~~~

Note how we access each element:

~~~javascript
songList3[j].title  ... songList3[j].artist
~~~

Each element is an object, so we can access each attribute using '.' and then the name of the attribute.

# Exercises

For these exercises, create:

- arrays-05.html
- arrays-05.js

Use this contents for the html file:

## arrays-05.html

~~~
<html> 
  <head>
    <title>JavaScript Test Site</title>
    <script src="arrays-05.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Nothing going on yet.</p>

</html>

## Exercise 1: 

Extend songList3 to include a 'duration' field for each song. This should be a simple number. Have the this number included in the log when the list is printed out.

## Exercise 2:

Output the total number of songs when all song details have been printed out.

## Exercise 3:

Along with the total number of songs, see if you can also print out the total duration. This should be a simple total of the duration of all individual songs.
