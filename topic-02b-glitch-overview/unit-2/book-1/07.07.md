# WebStorm & Node

You have been using the IntelliJ Idea IDE for some time now:

- <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/>

There is a sister product called WebStorm:

- <https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/>

Download and install this now. You can use the same account you used for IDEA to set up the license.

On your workstation, install Node.js:

- <https://nodejs.org>

be sure to select the `LTS` version, NOT the current version.
