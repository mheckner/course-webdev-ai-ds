# Introducing JSON

In javascript, it can sometimes be very convenient to use a notation to represent a data structure, but without any additional javascript constructs. Javascript Object Notation (JSON) is designed for this purpose. Here is a new file to represent our playlists in JSON format, create it in your app now:

## models/playlist-store.json

~~~js
{
  "playlistCollection": [
    {
      "title": "Beethoven Sonatas",
      "songs": [
        {
          "title": "Piano Sonata No. 3",
          "artist": "Beethoven"
        },
        {
          "title": "Piano Sonata No. 7",
          "artist": "Beethoven"
        },
        {
          "title": "Piano Sonata No. 10",
          "artist": "Beethoven"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Beethoven Concertos",
      "songs": [
        {
          "title": "Piano Concerto No. 0",
          "artist": "Beethoven"
        },
        {
          "title": "Piano Concerto No. 4",
          "artist": "Beethoven"
        },
        {
          "title": "Piano Concerto No. 6",
          "artist": "Beethoven"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
~~~

We consider this to be a data file rather than a program. Although it looks superficially like javascript, you cannot put control structures, functions or other constructs in it. Also, the format is very strict, so the use of double quotes and separator commas is very precise. Any deviation will generate an error in any program that attempts to read it.

We can revise `playlist-store.js` to read this file now:

## models/playlist-store.js

~~~js
'use strict';

const playlistCollection = require('./playlist-store.json').playlistCollection;

module.exports = playlistCollection;
~~~

The program should behave exactly as before.
