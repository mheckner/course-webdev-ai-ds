# Git, Node & Webstorm

## Git

First make sure git is installed. To verify, open a commmand prompt/terminal and enter:

~~~bash
git --version
~~~

It shoudld report the version number. If you get 'command not found', then proceed to install git for your platform:

## Node

Check to see if node is installed:

~~~
node --version
~~~

If not, install from here:

- <https://nodejs.org>

be sure to select the `LTS` version, NOT the current version.

## Webstorm

You have been using the IntelliJ Idea IDE for some time now:

There is a sister product called WebStorm:

Download and install this now. You can use the same account you used for IDEA to set up the license.
