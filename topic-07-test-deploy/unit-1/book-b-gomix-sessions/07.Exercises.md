## Exercise 1

Test the application more comprehensively - signing up a range of users, and creating playlists. Make sure the users only see the playlists they have created.


## Exercise 2

Look at the `authenticate` method again:

~~~
  authenticate(request, response) {
    const user = userstore.getUserByEmail(request.body.email);
    if (user) {
      response.cookie('playlist', user.email);
      logger.info(`logging in ${user.email}`);
      response.redirect('/dashboard');
    } else {
      response.redirect('/login');
    }
  },
~~~

Can you see anything not quite right about it? 

Hint: what happens if incorrect password entered? Try this now.

See if you can fix this problem - i.e. only allow user to log in if they provide correct password.
