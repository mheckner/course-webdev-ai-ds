# Dashboard

Try the following now:

- Log in as 'homer@simpson', 'secret'. 
- Add a playlist called 'Homers First List'.
- logout
- Log in as 'marge@simpson', 'secret'. 

Notice that we are seeing Homers test playlist even when we log in as marge? The playlist-store.json may look like this:

~~~
{
  "playlistCollection": [
    {
      "id": "4a1ea4ec-303e-4b13-bd98-a6b04877e093",
      "title": "Homers First List",
      "songs": []
    }
  ]
}
~~~

(Glitch will probably not show the above - as the editor currently doesnt render the files accurately if they have been modified by another process. You should see the above, though, if you are running the app in Webstorm.)

We should only present the users with their own playlist - Marge should NOT be able to see Homers' list (as is currently the case).

Here is how we do it - all changes to the dashboard module:

## controller/dashboard.js

In the top of the module, import the new accounts module:

~~~
...
const accounts = require ('./accounts.js');
...
~~~

Revised addPlaylist action:

~~~javascript
...
  addPlaylist(request, response) {
    const loggedInUser = accounts.getCurrentUser(request);
    const newPlayList = {
      id: uuid.v1(),
      userid: loggedInUser.id,
      title: request.body.title,
      songs: [],
    };
    logger.debug('Creating a new Playlist', newPlayList);
    playlistStore.addPlaylist(newPlayList);
    response.redirect('/dashboard');
  },
...
~~~

Notice we find out who the logged in user is and then make sure that users ID is stored with the playlist.

Revised index action:

~~~javascript
...
  index(request, response) {
    logger.info('dashboard rendering');
    const loggedInUser = accounts.getCurrentUser(request);
    const viewData = {
      title: 'Playlist Dashboard',
      playlists: playlistStore.getUserPlaylists(loggedInUser.id),
    };
    logger.info('about to render', playlistStore.getAllPlaylists());
    response.render('dashboard', viewData);
  },
...
~~~

Notice in the above we are first finding out how the currently logged in user is - and then we are using that users id to get the correct playlists.

Log in again as marge and homer in turn, creating a single playlist (use a name you will remember). Make sure that the appropriate playlist appears in each users dashboard.


## The Stores

Looking at the playlist-store.json - it might (eventually when loaded) look something like this:

~~~
{
  "playlistCollection": [
    {
      "id": "1e6ed5a0-28fe-4527-8ce8-6cb5c800b5be",
      "userid": "2b6f0989-7b7f-4a38-ad26-aa06b922d751",
      "title": "marges playlist",
      "songs": []
    },
    {
      "id": "07dd66fe-9f8f-456c-944d-48330bde4610",
      "userid": "3ad52697-6d98-4d80-8273-084de55a86c0",
      "title": "homers playlist",
      "songs": []
    }
  ]
}
~~~

Each playlist has and id + a userid, which identifies the user how 'owns' the playlist.
